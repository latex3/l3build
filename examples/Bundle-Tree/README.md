L3BUILD `bundle-tree` example
=================================================

This example demonstrates a bundle of two modules, with each module arranged in a ‘tree’
structure. There is nothing noteworthy about the modules themselves; they are based on the
`simple-tree` example.

Note the importance of the nested `build.lua` scripts, especially the setting of `maindir`
in the build script for each module.
