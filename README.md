Overview
--------

The `l3build` module is designed to support the development of
high-quality LaTeX code by providing:
* A unit testing system
* Automated typesetting of code sources
* A reliable packaging system for CTAN releases

The bundle consists of a Lua script to run the tasks and a
`.tex` file which provides the testing environment. These were
originally developed for supporting LaTeX development but
are designed such that they can be readily used by others. Full
documentation is provided.
