.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The l3build system is a Lua script for building TeX packages, with particular
emphasis on regression testing. It is written in cross-platform Lua code, so
can be used by any modern TeX distribution with the texlua interpreter. A
package for building with l3build can be written in any TeX dialect; its
defaults are set up for LaTeX packages written in the DocStrip style.
